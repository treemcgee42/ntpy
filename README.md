# ntpy

Inspired by [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) and, more generally, [Instiki](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki/show/HomePage), 
this project is an attempt to create a math wiki maker in Rust using the Rocket framework. Currently there is basic request handling, page 
redirection, and a custom MD-to-HTML parser.
